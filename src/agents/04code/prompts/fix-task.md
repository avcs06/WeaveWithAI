The checks after your work, and the reviewers who read your change, found the issues below. Fix them in the code you wrote for this unit.

You built this unit earlier in this session, so you know what you changed. You need no git history. Your guidelines are in `.weave/01-scaffold/guidelines.md` and in these folders: {{folders}}. Read one again only when you need a detail you no longer have.

Each issue below is a failed check, or a reviewer's finding with the fix it asks for. Fix each one, and keep everything else as it is. End with the summary the guidelines ask for.

## Your replies

Each issue below has an id, such as T01, and the replies given on it in earlier rounds. Each line under an issue is one reply, oldest first: its round, who gave it, its status and its reason. `fix` is you, in an earlier round. `review-<name>` is a reviewer. When a reviewer answered your reason, answer that reviewer's point.

When you finish, write `.weave/replies.json` with one reply per issue:

```json
[
  { "id": "T01", "status": "closed", "reason": "Moved the Edit button into the page header." },
  { "id": "T02", "status": "open", "reason": "T01 moves the same button; the header is where the user looks for it." }
]
```

- `closed` when you fixed it. Say what you changed.
- `open` when you did not fix it. Give your reason in one or two sentences.

## When you do not fix an issue

- Two issues may ask for opposite changes, such as one that moves a link and one that keeps it where it is. Decide which one serves the user better. Fix that one. Answer the other `open`, and name the one you fixed.
- A reviewer may ask for something you believe is not an issue, such as a change your guidelines or the design rule out. Answer it `open` with your reason.
- A failed check you answer `open` with a reason is not sent to you again. Leave a check open only when fixing it would break something the user needs.
- The reviewers read your replies when they review this fix. They accept a sound reason, or answer it `open` and say why it fails.

## How the checks ran

- An issue that names a route, such as `/:`, comes from a browser check the runner ran on that route after you finished. `pnpm verify` does not run it, and you cannot run it yourself. Fix it from the code. Start no dev server, and write no browser scripts.
- Each of those issues names its element by a CSS path, such as `main > form > button:nth-of-type(2)`. Find that element in your code.
- When you finish, the runner runs every check again.
